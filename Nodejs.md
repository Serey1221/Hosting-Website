# How to Deploy Node.js/Express.js Application on Ubuntu Server

1. Connect with Server using SSH

Step 1: Connect with remote Server using SSH
Everything starts by connecting with a remote server. I use PuTTY to connect to the server using ssh.
use the given command

```sh
ssh <user>@<ip-address>
ssh root@123.45.67.890
```

2. Installation of Node.js

Ubuntu 20.04, By default, contains a version of node.js in the default repository.
We only need to install it. By using APT, for that, refresh your local package index

```sh
sudo apt update

sudo apt info nodejs

```

file setup script and save it into a file locally

```sh
curl -sl https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x -o

nodesource_setup.sh

nano nodesource_setup.sh

bash nodesource_setup.sh

sudo apt info nodejs

Now install Node.js

sudo apt install nodejs

```

Now install npm (Node Package Manager) with APT command

```sh
sudo apt install npm
```

Checking the version of node.js and npm

```sh
node -v & npm -v
```

3. Create a new Directory (if required) and initialize a new Node.js/Express.js Project

```sh
mkdir nodeApplication
cd nodeApplication
npm init
```

Answer the questions and add Express to the project

```sh
npm install express --save
```

Edit the file and add the code given below

```sh
nano app.js
#To Open/Edit File
#Add Folowing code
```

```node
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  const urlPath = req.url;
  if (urlPath === "/overview") {
    res.end('Welcome to the "overview page" of the nginX project');
  } else if (urlPath === "/api") {
    res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "application/json" });
    res.end(
      JSON.stringify({
        product_id: "xyz12u3",
        product_name: "NginX injector",
      })
    );
  } else {
    res.end("Successfully started a server");
  }
});

server.listen(3000, "localhost", () => {
  console.log("Listening for request");
});
```

For testing your application, makeapp.js executable :

```sh
 chmod +x ./app.js
```

Now Run the application.

```sh
 node app.js
```

4.  Install PM2 & Manage Application with It

PM2 is a process manager for Node.js applications. It provides an easy way to manage and demonize applications (run them in the background as a service).

Run the command given below to install PM2.

```sh
sudo npm install -g pm2
```

The -g option tells npm to install the module globally in this way it is available system-wide.
Execute the app.js command in the background by using the following command:

```sh
 pm2 start app.js
 pm2 list
 netstat -plant
```

5. Setup Nginx as a reverse proxy server
   As our application is working fine at localhost now we need to setup Nginx as a reverse proxy server so that it is accessible for the users.

Run the command to edit the following file:

```sh
 sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

```proxy
    location / {
        proxy_pass http: //localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
```

Exit the file after saving it.

To verify there is no syntax error run the command given below:

```sh
 sudo nginx -t
```

Restart Nginx.

```sh
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

You should now be able to access your application via
the Nginx reverse proxy by accessing your serverâ€™s URL.
